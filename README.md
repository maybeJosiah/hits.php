# hits.php
This is a PHP page view counter. It records number of page loads per month and can go to high numbers. Replace ending string with path from root of hosting. I have gugquettex.com/stats/hits.php in this example. Released under https://gugquettex.com/en/blog/copyright.php, basically use as you will. To use, have in a like empty directory and like this in your other web pages:

include $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . '/stats/hits.php';

You may need to edit source file nearly same unless like mine it is in website/stats. All as per one might be maybe or might not be maybe, maybe or maybe not, maybe.
