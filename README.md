# hits.php
This is a PHP page view counter.
It records number of page loads per month and can go to high numbers.
Replace ending string with path from root of hosting.
I have gugquettex.com/stats/hits.php in this example.
You may omit comment.
Released under gugquettex.com/en/blog/copyright.php, basically use as you will.
To use, have in a like empty directory and like this in your other web pages:

include $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . '/stats/hits.php';

All as per one might be maybe or might not be maybe, maybe or maybe not, maybe.
